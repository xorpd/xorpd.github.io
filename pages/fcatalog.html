	<h1>FCatalog</h1>

<p><em>FCatalog</em> (The functions catalog) is a mechanism for finding similarities
between different binary blobs in an efficient manner. It is mostly useful for
identifying a new binary blob is somewhat similar to a binary blob that have
been encountered before. </p>
<p>The client side of FCatalog is an IDA plugin that allows a group of reverse
engineers to manage a pool of reversed functions. Whenever a new binary
function is encountered, FCatalog can compare it to all the known and
previously reversed binary functions.</p>
<p>If you are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering">reverse
engineer</a>, FCatalog can help
you find function that are similar to functions your team have already reversed
and named. Never reverse the same function again!</p>
<p>FCatalog is made of two parts: A server and a client. The client can be used as
an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Disassembler">IDA</a> plugin, or as
a python module.</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/xorpd/fcatalog_server">server</a> and the 
<a href="https://github.com/xorpd/fcatalog_client">client</a> on github.
There is even a <a href="https://github.com/xorpd/fcatalog_docker">dockerized version of the
server</a> if you are more of a docker
person.</p>
<p>You can use the test FCatalog server at <strong>testfcatalog.xorpd.net:1337</strong> if you
just want to try the FCatalog client with IDA. Note that the test database will
be deleted every once in a while.</p>
<h2>Tech stack</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The FCatalog server runs on linux (Tested on Ubuntu &gt;= 14.04). It is written
  in python3 with Asyncio for networking (Requires python &gt;= 3.4), and uses
  sqlite3 for persistency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The FCatalog client is written in python2.7, and runs as an IDA plugin. I
  tested it on IDA 6.6 It might work on some other versions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The binary function is, in many cases, the atomic execution part of a modern
computer program. Most modern tools for reverse engineering divide the code
into different functions. Reverse engineers can then divide their job of
understanding the big program into smaller chunks: Understanding the operation
of each function. </p>
<p>Naming functions is a key factor for understanding big programs.</p>
<p>It happens often that the same function shows up a few times in the same
binary, or shows up in a few different binaries, maybe of the same product in
different versions. Good reversers can usually notice when they spot the same
function twice. However, this could get tedious for large databases of code. In
addition, when working as a team, two reversers might reverse the same function
twice, or reverse two very similar functions.</p>
<p>FCatalog was written to make sure no function is reversed twice. It also allows
to gain insights about a new function from similar functions that were already
reversed and named.</p>
<p>FCatalog allows you to keep a database of all your named functions, and find
similarities from this database efficiently. </p>
<h2>Methods of calculating similarity</h2>

<p>Much has been said about finding the similarity between different binary
functions. I will begin with the main requirements from such a similarity
scheme:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Speed: One should be able to calculate the similarity between two binary
  functions quickly, because for every function we want to search for
  similarity in large databases of already named functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overcome small changes: Should be able to identify similarity even when some
  small changes happen, like changes of some bytes, or chunks of bytes that
  have moved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Portable: Should work for many processors and architectures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I will describe here the main methods I have noticed. Finally I will
explain the algorithm used for FCatalog.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance">Edit distance</a>: One can
  calculate the edit distance between two different binary functions (Treating
  the two functions as binary blobs) in order to calculate the similarity
  between them. This similarity score works pretty well, however it is a bit
  slow to calculate, and requires keeping the binary of all the functions
  inside the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stripping operands from instructions: It is possible to use the IDA analysis
  of the function and read the instructions as text, without taking their
  operands. Finally, take some cryptographic hash, like sha256 on the text of
  all the instructions in the function. This method has the disadvantage of
  being not very sensitive to changes in the function.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="fcatalog_pics/strip_operands.png"/><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Analyzing the function graph: IDA knowns how to generate a graph view for
  each function. This graph is generated by considering the various branches
  inside the function. It is possible to keep the graph of the function, and
  then trying to somehow compare it to graphs of other functions. I have never
  tried this myself, but I think that many not so large functions might have
  the same graph structure.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Catalog1 similarity algorithm</h2>

<p>The Catalog1 similarity algorithm is an algorithm for comparing two arbitrary
binary blobs (Not necessarily binary functions). For every binary blob of size
\(n\) it can generate a constant size signature in \(O(n)\) operations. To
compare two blobs, one has to compare their two constant size signatures. The
amount of matching parts of the two signatures will be the similarity grade for
the two binary blobs.</p>
<p>As the signature is of constant size, it is easy to save all the signatures
inside the database, instead of the binary of the functions themselves. In
addition, after doing the one time work of calculating functions signatures, it
is possible to calculate the similarity between two functions in \(O(1)\)
operations, by comparing their constant size precalculated signatures.</p>
<h3>The basic idea behind catalog1</h3>

<p>Let \(a\) and \(b\) be two binary blobs. By binary blobs we mean a string of
bytes. we denote by \(S(a)\) to be the set of all consecutive 4 bytes from
\(a\). For example, if \(a = 123xy1\) then \(S(a) =
\{123x,23xy,3xy1\}\). If, on the other hand, \(a = 11111\) then \(S(a) =
\{1111\}\), because sets can contain every element only once.</p>
<p>Basically, for two binary blobs \(a,b\), the Catalog1 algorithm calculates an
approximation for \(\frac{S(a) \cap S(b)}{S(a) \cup S(b)}\), which is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index">Jaccard similarity coefficient</a> of
the two sets \(S(a),S(b)\).</p>
<p>Some thoughts about the meaning of this formula:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Catalog1 algorithm assumes that the set \(S(a)\) encapsulates enough
  information to almost reconstruct the binary blob \(a\). This is not true in
  all cases, but we assume that it works in most practical cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Jaccard index of two sets says something about how similar those two sets
  are. It is a number between \(0\) and \(1\). If the sets have zero
  intersection, it will be \(0\). If the two sets are exactly the same, it will
  be \(1\). We use the Jaccard index to find out how similar are the two sets
  \(S(a)\) and \(S(b)\). Hopefuly this should tell us how similar are the two
  binary blobs \(a\) and \(b\).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Acheiving constant size signature</h3>

<p>We promised above a constant sized signature for each binary blob \(a\),
however the set \(S(a)\) is not constant sized. We want a way to compress the
information inside \(S(a)\) into a constant sized construct. Of course this is
not possible because of information considerations. That said, we could get an
approximation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinHash">MinHash</a> allows to create such a
signature. The MinHash method allows to encode a set into a constant sized
signature. Using the resulting signatures one can approximate the Jaccard Index
of two sets.</p>
<p>It works as follows: We assume a world \(X\) of possible set elements. (In our
case above the set of elements of the world are all the possible combinations
of consecutive 4 bytes). We also assume the existence of \(k\) random hashes
\(h_1 \cdots h_k\), where \(h_i: X \rightarrow [0,1]\).</p>
<p>Now assume that we are given some set \(T \subseteq X\). (T could be a set of
the form \(S(a)\) for some binary blob \(a\), for example). We want to create a
constant sized signature for this set. We do it as follows. For each \(1 \leq i
\leq k\) we calculate \(sig_i(T) := \min_{t \in T}{h_i(t)}\). Finally we get
\(sig(T) := (sig_1(T), \cdots , sig_k(T))\), which is a constant size signature.</p>
<p>For two sets \(A,B\) we can approximate the Jaccard Index \(J(A,B) := \frac{A
\cap B}{A \cup B}\) by counting the amount of matching entries between \(sig(A),
sig(B)\) and dividing by \(k\). This will work because it turns out,
\(\Pr[sig_i(A) = sig_i(B)] = J(A,B)\).</p>
<p>Generally, if we pick bigger \(k\) we can get a better approximation of the
Jaccard Index \(J(A,B)\), but the signatures will get bigger and harder to
calculate.</p>
<p>Back to our world of binary blobs: If we are given a binary blob \(a\), we first
calculate the set \(S(a)\), and then we calculate \(sign(S(a))\) to get a
constant sized signature. </p>
<p>In other words, we need \(k\) random hash functions from the world of \(4\)
consecutive bytes into \([0,1]\). For each of those random hash function we
calculate the minimum value over all the possible consecutive \(4\) bytes in the
binary blob \(a\). We collect all those minimums, and we form a constant sized
signature of size \(k\).</p>
<h3>Getting random hashes</h3>

<p>Where do we get the random hashes from? More specifically, we mentioned above
random hashes from the world of \(4\) consecutive bytes (We can also call these
kind of elements
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_%28computer_architecture%29">DWORDS</a>) into
\([0,1]\). The set \([0,1]\) is somewhat impractical to program, so we can
change it to be the same set of the domain: All possible \(4\) consecutive
bytes. </p>
<p>If we defind \(DWORD = \{0,1,\cdots,2^{32}-1\}\), then our random hash functions
should be functions of the form \(h:DWORD \rightarrow DWORD\). To make sure we
don't "waste information", we can pick
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation">permutations</a> as a special case of
hash functions.</p>
<p>But where can we get \(k\) random permutations from \(DWORD\) to \(DWORD\)? We
can invent them ourselves. We just want to make sure that they will be pretty
different from each other, and that they will be easy to calculate.</p>
<p>We could pick, for example, that \(h_i(x)\) would be the last 4 bytes of sha256
of the string \(str(i) + &#34;||&#34; + str(x))\) (Where + is concatanation),
but that would be somewhat slow to calculate, and it will not give us
permutations.</p>
<p>Generally one can generate pretty random permutations by moving numbers through
random tables, adding, xoring and rotating numbers. Doing a few of those tricks
one can get this kind of result:</p>

<p>This code calculates the minimum for every permutation function over every 4
consecutive bytes of the binary blob. Note that this code was written in
python3 (So be careful with strings and bytes). If you want to try it, you can
find it <a href="https://github.com/xorpd/fcatalog_server/blob/master/fcatalog/fcatalog/catalog1.py">here</a>.</p>
<p>The signing function is called slow_sign for a reason. It is a bit slow when
implemented in python. The FCatalog server uses a compiled C version of this
function, which runs much faster. It is still an open question for me if this
kind of function could be possibly implemented efficiently using pure python.</p>
<h2>The FCatalog Database</h2>

<p>The FCatalog database is implemented as an sqlite3 database (Using the python
bindings). Choosing sqlite3 was mostly due to ease of use. Postgresql might
have given me better performance, but I came to the conclusion that most of my
reverse engineer friends are not fans of complicated technology, and will
prefer a database that fits in a file every day.</p>
<p>Indeed, the major advantage of this storage method is that one can just copy
the database files and put them somewhere else, without any specific knowledge
of how they work, and what is inside. It is also much easier to install the
server, as it has less dependencies.</p>
<p>Each database is kept in its own sqlite file. Each such database has a unique
name, and it contains one table of functions. Every row contains the name of
the function, the head comment of that function and the Catalog1 signature of
that function. It also contains a sha256 hash of the function's binary. The
function binary is not kept inside the database.</p>
<p>Whenever the user wants to query for a local function, he sends a binary blob
representing the function to the server. The server then calculates the
Catalog1 signature of that function, and looks for this signature inside the
database.</p>
<p>Searching for a signature inside the database is done by searching for each
entry of the signature first (In my implementation there are 16 permutations,
so 16 entries), then a UNIQUE UNION over all the results, and finally a more
specific search for the best signature match. It seems to work fast enough. I
still wonder if there is a faster way to do it, in the form of a smarter
algorithm. (That hopefully will behave nicely with sqlite).</p>
<h2>Using FCatalog</h2>

<h3>Installation notes</h3>

<p>You will need IDA &gt;= 6 with IDAPython to enjoy the fcatalog_client, so install
it first.  Next, install the fcatalog_client as a plugin for IDA. See here the
<a href="https://github.com/xorpd/fcatalog_client">installation instructions</a>.</p>
<p>Note that the plugin is written for python2.7, which is the current python
version used for IDAPython.</p>
<p>You will also need a server. To try FCatalog you can use the test server at
testfcatalog.xorpd.net:1337. If you want your own server, check out the <a href="https://github.com/xorpd/fcatalog_server">server
installation instructions</a>.</p>
<h3>Basic workflow</h3>

<p>When you open some file in IDA you will notice that you have new items in the
EDIT menu:</p>
<p><img src="fcatalog_pics/fcatalog_client_menu.png"/><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Clean IDB: Clean your database from any changes made to function names by
    FCatalog.</li>
<li>Find Similars: Find functions from the remote FCatalog database that might
    be similar to functions on your IDB.</li>
<li>Commit Functions: Commit all your named functions to the remote FCatalog
    database.</li>
<li>Configure: Configure FCatalog Client.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will usually begin by configuring FCatalog client.</p>
<p><img src="fcatalog_pics/fcatalog_client_configuration.png"/><br/></p>
<p>The configuration window contains the hostname of the remote server and the
TCP port used for connection. If you use the test server, you should put in
testfcatalog.xorpd.net as hostname, and 1337 as port. </p>
<p>Next, you have to fill in a database name. You can pick any name that you want.
If the database does not exist, the server will create it. If you have access
to the FCatalog server, you will be able to view all the created databases in
the linux path /var/lib/fcatalog.</p>
<p>When you click OK the configuration will be applied and saved inside the IDB.
(Currently it is saved in hackish way as the first comment on the first line. If
you know of a nicer way, please tell me about it).</p>
<p>Having a working configuration is required for running "Find Similars" and
"Commit Functions" operations.</p>
<h3>Commiting and Finding similar Functions</h3>

<p>You are working on some reversing project and you managed to understand what
some functions do. You also managed to find a good name to each of those
functions. Good! Now you can share those functions with the rest of your team.
This can be done using the "Commit Functions" button. Click on this button.</p>
<p>All your properly named functions (that are also large enough) will be uploaded
to the FCatalog server's database.</p>
<p>As the "Commit Functions" operation can take a while, it is executed in the
background. Be patient, you can see information about progress at IDA's output
window.</p>
<p>After a while you open a new IDB for a similar project. Maybe it's a new
version of the same product, or just another binary file of the same processor
type. It's time to use your FCatalog database. Click on the "Find Similars"
button. </p>
<p>You will now be asked for a similarity grade cut. This means: How many
entries of the signatures should be equal between two functions for us to
consider those functions to be similar. The current implementation of Catalog1
in FCatalog uses 16 permutations. A reasonable similarity grade cut would be 9.
You can use smaller values if you want more results. If you pick 1, for
example, you will get a lot of results, but most of them will be not very
accurate. If you pick 16, you will only get almost exact matches.</p>
<p>Every function in your IDB that has a similar match in the FCatalog
database will be given a special name. The name will be of the form:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>FCATALOG __ &lt;similarity_grade&gt; __ &lt;Matched Function Name&gt; __ &lt;address&gt;
</pre></div>


<p>Similarity grade is a number between \(0\) and \(16\) (This is the amount
of matching entries between the two functions: The function from the IDB and
the remote function found on the FCatalog database).</p>
<p>Matched Function name is the name of the function found at the remote FCatalog
database. This should give you a hint about what your local function is. It
might not always be a good match, but in many cases it will give you a good
clue.</p>
<p>Address is the address of your local function. This is added for uniqueness of
the name, because more than one of your local functions could be similar to the
same remote function from the FCatalog database.</p>
<p>Some examples of FCatalog style function names:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>FCATALOG__12___atoldbl_l__0042D16A
FCATALOG__14__write_to_nvram__005139C2
</pre></div>


<p>The FCATALOG prefix and the following grade can help you sort the functions in
the functions window, and spot important matches.</p>
<p>Running "Find Similars" will not override your own named functions. It can only
set names for unnamed functions, or functions that have an FCATALOG style
name.</p>
<p>As you continue working on your reversing project, you should click "Commit
Functions" from time to time after you name a few interesting new functions,
and click "Find Similars" after other reversers on your team tell you they have
added some new functions to the database.</p>
<h3>FCatalog Databases management</h3>

<p>You should use different databases for binaries of different architectures.
For example, you don't want to find x86 functions that look like PowerPC
functions. That would be meaningless.</p>
<p>A good practice would be to add the architecture as a prefix to the database
name. For example: x86_SomeProgram or arm_SomePhoneApp.</p>
<p>Databases can not be deleted from the client side. In addition, currently there
is no option of viewing all the databases on the server from the client side.
If you own the server, you can look at /var/lib/fcatalog to see all the
databases. If you want to delete a file, make sure to stop the FCatalog server
first.</p>
