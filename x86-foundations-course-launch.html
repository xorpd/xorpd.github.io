<p>The x86 Foundations Course is ready! You can study x86 Assembly from scratch
today. I release <a href="https://www.udemy.com/x86-asm-foundations/?couponCode=x86_foundations_launch">30 free coupons for the course</a>
Please take a coupon only if you really plan on studying this. I'm looking for
people who could give me some real feedback about the learning experience.</p>
<p>If there are no more free coupons, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/x86-asm-foundations/?couponCode=xorpd_website">you can buy the course at
udemy</a>.</p>
<p>As an alternative, if you are an experienced assembly programmer, Doing the
exercises might be enough for you. The exercises are open source, 
<a href="https://github.com/xorpd/asm_prog_ex">and you can get them on github</a>.
In that case, don't be afraid to send me some feedback or questions about the
exercises.</p>
<h2>About the course</h2>
<h3>What is assembly language</h3>
<p>Assembly language is the language your processor talks. Knowing it should give
you better understanding of how your computer works, and if you are a
programmer: how your programs work. It doesn't matter what kind of programming
you do, It will make you a much better programmer.</p>
<h3>Previous knowledge assumed</h3>
<p>The course assumes that you know nothing. Maybe just a bit of how to add and
subtract numbers, but come on, if you survived so far in our civilization you
must know how to add and subtract numbers :)</p>
<p>That said, even if you are a skilled programmer in some higher level programming
language, you are going to earn much from doing this course.</p>
<h3>The course Structure</h3>
<p>The course is made of Video Lectures, and Exercises. For almost every video
lecture you will find corresponding exercises. The exercises make sure that you
understood the lecture, and also that you will remember what you have learned
there. Some of the exercises will teach you something that was not explained in
the lectures. Every lecture depends on the knowledge acquired from the previous
lectures.</p>
<p>I am really proud of the
video lectures. They were hard for me to do, as I am not a native English
speaker. However I think that the really important part of the course are the
exercises. I should tell you this up front- If you want to become a real
assembly programmer, much work is to be done. I wrote all the exercises for you,
lined up gradually, but it is really up to you to do those exercises.</p>
<p>If you watch all the video lectures you will probably learn something, however
if you complete all the exercises, I guarantee that you will never be the same.</p>
<h3>Technical details</h3>
<p>For the tech Savvy, some technical summary of the course:
The course will teach you how to write assembly programs on the Windows
operations system, using <a href="http://www.flatassembler.net">FASM</a> - The Flat
Assembler. The programming in this course is done in 32 bits protected mode.
That means - No interrupts and no memory segments. Every assembly programmer
will tell you that this is the good life :)</p>
<p>As this is a basic course, we don't get to the part of writing real Windows GUI
(Graphical User Interface) programs, but we almost touch it. The last
program in the course is about really simple GUI. When you finish the course you
will have the skills and the knowledge to learn it by yourself. Maybe if I have
the time at some point, I will write a course about that.</p>
<h3>The course contents</h3>
<p>Some subjects that are covered in this course:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Numeric systems and the Binary system.</p>

<h2>Meta</h2>
<p>I dealt with Assembly and the low level for a really long part of my life. I
spent many years trying to understand why some small thing doesn't work, and how
to fix it, Or what some strange combination of three assembly instructions do.</p>
<p>During that time many friends and coworkers asked me if I could explain them how
to learn those subjects. It took a few years until I felt that I became the
right person to teach this kind of material. Even just for the few who asked me,
I am happy to present this course.</p>
<p>It took a really long time to make this. Much more than I expected. The lectures
were recorded back in my home country, and I never realized how hard it could be
to talk every day for hours. I did it for months, and I was so happy when I
finished. </p>
<p>Then came the editing. Most of them were done at Tokyo, about 3-4 hours a day. I
felt that I had to do it at least once, to know what it is like. As I am not a
native English speaker, I really had to edit a lot. There were some days that I
thought I am going to give up, sitting in a Cafe in Tokyo editing those videos.
But eventually I finished.</p>
<p>Finally I had to deal with some smaller technical details. They were pretty
small technically speaking, however they had some really big impact. The Udemy
team helped me with choosing the correct length for the lectures (In the
beginning some of them were one hour long!), the price for the course and much
more. The final launch of the course at Udemy happened yesterday. I got it on my
laptop, here in Peru.</p>
<p>I also put on this web page. This was done using Pelican with github pages. I
didn't deal with websites for years, and I have to admit I enjoyed it. There is
still much to be done about the design of this web page, but I think it's a
start. After dealing so much with the low level, doing something so high level
always impresses me.</p>
<p>It's your turn now. I really hope this course will be of use to you. </p>
<p>And Finally - If you are that kid sitting in the basement with your computer,
willing and ready to learn but you can't afford it, don't be shy - send me a
message at xorpd at xorpd dot net. I'm sure we can have a solution for that.</p>
