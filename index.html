    <p>The x86 assembly course covers the basics of assembly programming.</p>
<p>After taking this course, you are going to be able to write your own assembly
programs that actually do useful things. You will also gain solid understanding
about how low level things work in computers today.</p>
<h2>Getting the Course:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>For beginners:</strong> <a href="https://www.udemy.com/x86-asm-foundations/?couponCode=xorpd_website2">Buy the video
    course (Udemy)</a>. The course
    contains video lectures on different assembly subjects. Every lecture have a
    few exercises that should be done, in order to consolidate what you have
    learned. You get 50% discount if you buy it through this website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>For experienced programmers:</strong> Maybe you don't really need all the material
    at the video course. Just download the exercises from this website for
    free, and start doing them from the beginning to end. If you have any
    questions, feel free to send them to me.</p>

<h2>Why learn Assembly language?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To become a better programmer: Having a solid understanding of the low level
    will make a better programmer out of you, no matter what programming language
    you use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Malware research: If you ever want to understand how viruses really work, or
    maybe even fight malware yourself, you have to obtain solid understanding of
    the assembly language. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For optimization: Learn to write fast code - Talk directly to the processor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the history lesson: Get a full history lesson of the ways of the great
    programmers of the past, and code like them. Learn about decisions of
    engineers of old times, and how they affect us today, in the current x86
    architecture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the Curios: Maybe you always wanted to know how things really work. Here
    you can exeperience yourself some assembly programming.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>System Requirements:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The course assumes that you have an x86 processor on your computer. (If you
    are not sure, most likely that you have one).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will need a windows operation system to do the course. (All the exercises
    are running on windows, and were only tested on the windows operation system.
    For any other operation system, you will be on your own with the exercises, at
    least for now).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The course uses the <a href="http://www.flatassembler.net">Flat Assembler (FASM)</a> by
    Thomas Gryzstar.</p>
